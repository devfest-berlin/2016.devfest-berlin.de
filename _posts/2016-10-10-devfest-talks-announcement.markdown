Less than a month left to our annual DevFest and work piles up on our side.
Thankfully, we have an awesome community that submitted great talks for Android, Web, Golang and Cloud.
It has been an intense task to do, but finally we came with our selection of talks and workshops.

We are happy to announce that we will have SIX (you read it right) workshops on Friday.
And on Saturday, more than twenty full length talks and three lightning talks for all kinds of Google technologies.

Head here for the full [schedule](http://2016.devfest-berlin.de/schedule/).

We hope you are excited just as we are, and to see you Friday 11th at ImmobilienScout24!
