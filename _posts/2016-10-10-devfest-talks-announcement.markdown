Less than a two weeks left to our annual DevFest and we're on the last stretch to make it an awesome event yet again. Thankfully, we have an awesome community that submitted great talks for Android, Web, Golang and Cloud.
It has been an intense task to do, but finally we came with our selection of talks and workshops.

We are happy to announce that we will have FIVE (you read it right) workshops on Friday.
And on Saturday, more than twenty full length talks for all kinds of Google technologies.

Head over [here for the full schedule](http://2016.devfest-berlin.de/schedule/).

We hope you are excited just as we are, and to see you Friday 11th at ImmobilienScout24!

Also: we still have tickets left, [grab them while you can here](http://2016.devfest-berlin.de/tickets/)
